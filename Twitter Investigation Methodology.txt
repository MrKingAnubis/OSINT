RealWorld Application: In 2019,1 wasinvestigating a death threat toward a celebrity. I launche weet
and began monitoring. First, I created a search column with "to:myclient". This started a stream o
people mentioning my client, which was too much to monitor. Next, I created a column of to.m} c lent ’
die OR shoot OR death". This presented ver}’ few tweets being sent to the celebrity including speci ic ate u
words. However, it did identify a suspect. A tweet was sent to the celebrity stating I hope you die a ier} * ea
tonight". I then created another column of "from:suspect to:myclient". This identified ever}’ tweet ic was
sending to the celebrity. Since I had to move on to other resources, I set one final Tweet Deck co umn o 
"from:suspect to:myclient kill OR die OR shoot ORdeath" and added an alert. This instructed Tweet ec ' to
play an audible sound if any new messages met the criteria. The same suspect was arrested a wee * ater \\ i e
attempting to burglarize her apartment
